# Matplotlib_challenge
In this challenge, I have compared how effect ten different drugs have been on mice with tumors.


Observations of this data set
  1. Ramicane seems to be the most effiect drug
  2. The longer exposure to the drug, the more effective it becomes
  3. There is an equal distribution of Male/Female speciemens, allowing us to find if a drugs effectiveness can be determined by a speciemens sex.
